Hi there! I am Jo√£o (something like John in English), a former biology teacher who made a career transition to technology as a developer.

My current study and work are focused on Java, Kotlin and Flutter for mobile development.

I have academic experience in technical research and extension projects, which helped me to develop communicative skills, teamwork, collaboration, experience with event organization and project management, as well as conduct research to solve problems with continuous learning.

I also have teaching experience with elementary, high school and university students. I am always willing to learn new technologies from both front-end and back-end. My current knowledge includes a bit of web, and C.

Education:

Systems Analysis and Development (2020-2021)

Software Engineering (2019)

Master of Environmental Education (2016-2017)

Biology (2012-2015)
