Hi there! My name is João (something like John in English), I'm a former biology teacher who is now a Flutter developer with 2 Android apps published on Google Play (and a few more on the way). My current study and work is focused on Android development, but with Flutter's capabilities, I'm expanding into iOS and Windows development.
