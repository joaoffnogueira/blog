Usually, the problem is that `Android APK Support` plugin is disable and enabling it should resolve the problem.

_Android Studio wizard print, with "Create New Flutter Project" option highlighted._

Try this:

1. On `Configure -> Plugins` check if:

   a. `Dart` and `Flutter` plugins are checked as enabled.

   b. `Android APK Support` is checked as enabled.

2. Restart Android Studio.

If still is not there, remove and reinstall `Dart` and `Flutter` plugins.
